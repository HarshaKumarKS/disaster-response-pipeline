# Udacity-Disaster-Response-Project

## Description

This project is for the Data Engineering section in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. The bassis of this project is to look at data provided by FigureEight. The data are tweets and texts that were sent during real world disasters and can be labeled into at least one of 36 categories. The project aim is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to categorize messages on a real time basis.

This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Create ETL of data from CSV files and upload cleansed data to a database
2. Build a machine learning algorithm to analyze messages and optomize model classify the text message in various categories
3. Run a web app which can show model results in real time


## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+

### Libraries 
1. NumPy 
2. SciPy 
3. Pandas
4. Sciki-Learn
5. NLTK 
6. SQLalchemy 
7. Pickle 
8. Flask 
9. Plotly

### Installation
To clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/HarshaKumarKS/disaster-response-pipeline.git
```

### Execution:
1. You can run the following commands in the project's directory to set up the database, train model and save the model.

    *  Run ETL pipleine by cleaning and storing the data into the DB

        - `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`

    * Run ML pipeline that loads data from DB, train and saves the classifier as a pickle file

       -  `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
   
   - `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

## Data observations

As can be seen from test data visualization most of the classes (categories) are highly imbalanced. This affects model F1 prediction score. One using this project should take this into consideration and apply measures like synthetic data generation, model selection and parameters fine-tuning, etc.
